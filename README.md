# Airbnb Clone Backend: Features and Functionalities Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the core features, functionalities, and technical requirements for the backend of an Airbnb clone application. The goal is to provide a comprehensive overview for developers to understand the necessary components for building a scalable, secure, and robust system.

## Project Requirements

The backend must enable key features that align with the functionalities of a rental marketplace.  This documentation is derived from the detailed project requirements found [here (link to the project requirements document, if available)].

## Detailed Features and Functionalities

A visual representation of the features and functionalities of the Airbnb Clone backend has been created using Draw.io. This diagram illustrates the key components of the system, including:

*   **User Management:** Registration, authentication, profile management.
*   **Property Listings Management:** Adding, editing, and deleting listings.
*   **Search and Filtering:** Location-based search, price range filtering, amenity selection.
*   **Booking Management:** Booking creation, cancellation, and status tracking.
*   **Payment Integration:** Secure payment processing, payouts to hosts, multi-currency support.
*   **Reviews and Ratings:** Guest reviews, host responses.
*   **Notifications System:** Email and in-app notifications for bookings, cancellations, and payments.
*   **Admin Dashboard:** User, listing, booking, and payment management.

The diagram also highlights the technical requirements, such as database design, API development, authentication and authorization mechanisms, file storage solutions, and integration with third-party services.

## Visual Representation

A PNG file visualizing the structure of these features can be found within this repository.
**This file includes the following information**:

*   **Feature Hierarchy**: This shows the hierarchical structure of different features and sub-features.
*   **Module Dependencies**: This shows which module depends on which module to provide seamless workflow for the Airbnb application.
*   **Data Flow**: This shows the flow of data with different modules involved to support the process.
